## 💻 CPU Scheduling Algorithms  

- **FCFS** – Non-preemptive, simple, may cause Convoy Effect  
- **SJF** – Preemptive/Non-preemptive, minimizes waiting time, needs burst time  

---

## 🚀 How to Run  

```bash
javac FirstComeFS.java
java FirstComeFS

javac SJF_Scheduling.java
java SJF_Scheduling
```
